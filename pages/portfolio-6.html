          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Computers can be categorized based on their size, processing power, and specific functions they perform. Each type of computer has unique characteristics, such as speed, memory, energy consumption, and computational ability. In this study, we will compare different types of computers, including supercomputers, mainframes, mini computers, microcomputers, workstations, and servers. The comparison will focus on specific aspects such as CPU capabilities, memory, processing speed, power consumption, and their typical fields of use.</p>

        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h2>Discussion</h2>
          <p>The computing landscape consists of various types of computers, each designed for specific tasks and performance requirements. From the immense processing power of supercomputers to the everyday use of microcomputers, these machines differ significantly in terms of capabilities, energy consumption, and fields of application.</p>
          <p>Supercomputers, for example, are used in research areas requiring immense computational power, such as weather modeling and complex simulations. In contrast, mainframe computers excel in handling large-scale enterprise operations, supporting mission-critical applications like banking systems and government databases. Mini computers, once widely used in small to mid-sized businesses, are now largely replaced by more powerful servers and workstations.</p>
          <p>Workstations provide high-performance capabilities for technical and creative applications, such as scientific research and 3D rendering. Servers, typically employed to manage network resources and host websites, play a vital role in ensuring continuous service availability and data integrity. Microcomputers, the most common type, are personal computers used for a variety of tasks, from office work to gaming, and are found in homes and businesses worldwide.</p>

        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <p>In the following table, we compare these different types of computers based on various key characteristics, including processing speed, memory capacity, power consumption, and typical usage scenarios. This comparison helps highlight the strengths and specific uses of each type of computer, offering a clearer understanding of their place in the modern technological ecosystem.</p>
