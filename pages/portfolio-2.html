            <h3>Data</h3>
            <li>
              <p>refers to recorded symbols and signal readings</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>These symbols can include text, numbers, diagrams, and images, while signals pertain to sensory readings such as light, sound, and touch (Liew, 2007)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Data serve primarily as a historical record of activities or situations, capturing a snapshot of reality or phenomena at a given time. However, data is often viewed as a mere representation with no intrinsic meaning until processed (Probst et al., 2000)</p>

            <h3>Knowledge</h3>
              <li>
                <p>encompasses cognition or recognition (know-what), capacity to act (know-how), and understanding (know-why) that resides within the human mind or brain (Liew, 2007)</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The primary purpose of knowledge is to enhance life quality and, within business contexts, to create or increase value for stakeholders </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>represents a deeper layer of understanding and application beyond mere data and information.</p>

        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Relationships & Distinctions</h3>
          <p>The interplay between data, information, and knowledge is often complex and context-dependent. 
            Data becomes information when it is processed and given context that renders it meaningful for decision-making (Pohl, 2001). 
            For instance, raw data in a spreadsheet becomes information when interpreted to highlight trends or patterns relevant to a business decision.</p>
          <p>Information transforms into knowledge when it is internalized and applied to guide actions or understanding.
            Knowledge is built on the foundation of processed information, incorporating personal experiences and cognitive processes (Boisot & Canals, 2004).
            As such, knowledge involves a subjective and interpretive process that can vary significantly among individuals.</p>
          <p>This transformation underscores why data, information, and knowledge are often perceived as interchangeable. 
            The confusion arises because they occupy overlapping roles in the process of understanding and decision-making. 
            For example, a book can be viewed as data (in its form as physical text), information (when read and interpreted by a reader), or knowledge (when it informs and enhances understanding) (Liew, 2007).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Practical Implications</h3>
          <p>The distinction between data and information is significant in managing what is often termed "information overload."
            Many argue that the issue is not an overload of information but rather an overload of unprocessed data (Pohl, 2001).
            Properly organized and contextualized data can effectively become information, but without this transformation, data alone remains less useful.</p>
          <p>Knowledge management processes aim to convert data into useful information and subsequently into actionable knowledge. 
            This involves not just the collection and storage of data but also the effective processing and interpretation that can lead to meaningful insights and value creation (Klimešová, 2009).</p>
            Data serves as the raw material, information provides context and relevance, and knowledge represents a deeper level of understanding and application.</p>

          <h3>Evolution and Importance of Information Systems</h3>
          <p>Information Systems have evolved significantly to address the increasing need for effective data management and strategic decision-making in organizations. According to Abdelkebir, Maleh, and Belaissaoui (2020), information systems are at the core of organizational efficiency and strategy. They facilitate the collection, processing, and dissemination of information, which is essential for gaining competitive advantage.
            Modern information technologies and Knowledge Management Systems (KMSs) are pivotal in accelerating information flows, enhancing process reliability, and supporting both tacit and explicit knowledge within organizations (Abdelkebir et al., 2020; Galliers, 2006; Halawi et al., 2005; Wickramasinghe, 2003).</p>
          <p>Despite their potential, new information technologies do not always ensure the efficiency of information systems. The continuous evolution of IS to address issues like integration, interoperability, and agility in alignment with organizational strategies remains a significant challenge (Abdelkebir et al., 2020). 
            Information systems are often described as the "nervous system" of organizations, reflecting their operational effectiveness and strategic alignment (Dove, 1995; Van Grembergen & De Haes, 2009; Zhang & Sharifi, 2000).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Conceptualizing Information Systems</h3>
          <p>The term "Information System" encompasses various conceptualizations, including technological, social, socio-technical, and process views. Boell and Cecez-Kecmanovic (2015) highlight that IS involves a mix of technologies such as computers, software, databases, and communication systems, which interact to fulfill organizational goals.
            The technology view focuses on the technical aspects of IT, while the social view emphasizes human interaction and interpretation. The socio-technical view integrates both social and technological components, addressing their interrelationship. The process view, on the other hand, concentrates on the activities supported by the IS (Boell & Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2015).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>The Role of Information Technology</h3>
          <p>Information Technology (IT), including hardware and software, serves as the delivery mechanism for IS. Paul (2010) notes that IT, when coupled with human action, forms an IS that is dynamic and changes over time.
            This dynamic nature of IS is crucial for adapting to evolving organizational needs and external conditions. The integration of IT with human decision-making processes helps organizations navigate their internal and external environments effectively (Paul, 2010).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Challenges and Future Directions in IS</h3>
          <p>The management of information systems involves numerous challenges, particularly in maintaining control and ensuring effectiveness across various processes. 
            Cram, Brohman, and Gallupe (2016) identify three primary areas for future research in IS control: examining controls that impact employee equality, managing emerging IS processes like enterprise architecture, and adopting an integrated approach to IS control. 
            Their research underscores the need for a comprehensive model that incorporates the interrelationships between different control dimensions to enhance IS effectiveness (Cram et al., 2016).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Evaluating Information Systems</h3>
          <p>Evaluating the effectiveness of information systems involves assessing both measurable and non-measurable contributions. Metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI), customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency are crucial, but so is the quality of the information provided by the system. 
            As noted by various sources, the ability to manage and utilize information effectively is essential for maintaining a competitive edge (Silerova & Kucirkova, 2008; ResearchGate, 2024).</p>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>In today’s digital landscape, distinguishing between data and information is fundamental to understanding how information systems (IS) function and add value to organizations. Data refers to raw, unprocessed facts and figures—such as numbers, dates, or text—that, on their own, don’t convey meaning. For example, a list of sales numbers without context is simply data. Information, on the other hand, is data that has been processed, organized, and analyzed to provide meaning and context. For instance, turning those sales numbers into a trend report showing growth over time transforms raw data into actionable insights.</p>
        <p>Information Systems (IS) are integral in managing and processing data to produce useful information. They consist of interconnected components designed to collect, store, process, and disseminate data. These systems also include a feedback mechanism to help organizations achieve their goals by improving decision-making and operational efficiency. The main components of an IS include technology (hardware and software), tasks (the activities and processes), people (users and developers), and structure (organizational framework).</p>
        <p>Below is a concise overview of the different types of support systems within information systems:        
          <ul>
            <li>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS): Handle daily operational tasks like order processing and payroll. They ensure smooth and accurate recording of transactions at the operational level.</li>
            <li>Process Control Systems (PCS): Monitor and control industrial processes such as manufacturing or power generation. They use real-time data to manage physical processes and ensure operational safety.</li>
            <li>Enterprise Collaboration Systems (Office Automation Systems): Enhance team communication and productivity through tools like email, video conferencing, and document sharing, supporting collaboration across the organization.</li>
            <li>Management Information Systems (MIS): Collect and summarize data from TPS to generate reports for middle management. These reports help in monitoring and controlling business operations.</li>
            <li>Decision Support Systems (DSS): Aid in complex decision-making by analyzing data from various sources and providing insights through models and simulations.</li>
            <li>Executive Information Systems (EIS): Provide senior management with high-level summaries and trends of internal and external data, often through visual dashboards, to support strategic decision-making.</li>
            <li>Expert Systems: Use AI to simulate human expertise in decision-making. They offer recommendations based on a set of rules and knowledge.</li>
            <li>Knowledge Management Systems (KMS): Capture, organize, and share organizational knowledge to enhance efficiency and support innovation.</li>
            <li>Strategic Information Systems (SIS): Align IT with business strategies to gain a competitive advantage and support long-term organizational goals.</li>
            <li>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems: Integrate various business functions into a unified system, providing real-time data and improving overall efficiency across departments.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Understanding these systems and their roles helps organizations manage data effectively, transform it into valuable information, and leverage it to improve decision-making and operational efficiency. Each system supports different aspects of business operations, from daily tasks to strategic planning, ensuring that organizations remain competitive and efficient in a rapidly evolving business environment.</p>
