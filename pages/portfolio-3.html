          <h3>Introduction to Number Systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Number systems are fundamental frameworks used to represent and manipulate numbers using a consistent set of rules and symbols.</p></li>
            <li><p>A number system, also known as a numeral system, defines how numbers are expressed and understood in various contexts.</p></li>
            <li><p>The most commonly used number system is the decimal system, which employs ten digits (0–9) and is familiar in everyday life. However, other systems such as binary, octal, and hexadecimal are crucial, especially in computing and digital communication (Latif et al., 2011).</p></li>

          <h3>Binary and Decimal Systems in Computing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>In the digital realm, binary numbers, consisting of only two digits (0 and 1), are predominantly used because they align well with the two-state nature of computer hardware components.</p></li>
            <li><p>Computers operate using binary digits (bits) to process and store data.</p></li>
            <li><p>A bit represents the simplest form of information in a computer, and binary arithmetic allows for rapid computation and data manipulation (Dewhurst, 1988).</p></li>
            <li><p>Although humans typically work with the decimal system, interconversion between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal systems is crucial in computing tasks, such as encoding data for transmission or performing arithmetic operations in microprocessors (Latif et al., 2011)</p></li>
            <li><p>In computing, number systems are fundamental because they determine how data is stored, processed, and communicated within a computer's architecture. The total number of digits or symbols used in a number system is called its base or radix, which is crucial in defining the characteristics of the system (Mahat et al., 2020).</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
          
        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Positional Number Systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The positional number system, which includes binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal systems, assigns a place value to each digit depending on its position and the base of the system.</p></li>
            <li><p>This positional concept is the foundation of various number systems and underpins their practical use in computing and mathematics (Jha, 2020).</p></li>
            <li><p>For example, in a binary number, the place values increase from right to left as powers of two, just as decimal place values increase as powers of ten (Dewhurst, 1988).</p></li>
          </ul>

        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Overview of Numeral Systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>A numeral system, also referred to as a system of numeration, is a consistent method of representing numbers using a set of digits or symbols.</p></li>
            <li><p>The same sequence of symbols can represent different numbers depending on the numeral system being used.</p></li>
            <li><p>For instance, "11" represents eleven in the decimal system, three in the binary system, and two in the unary system (Robert, 2022). </p></li>
            <li><p>Different numeral systems have varying capabilities; for example, Roman numerals do not include a symbol for zero. A well-structured numeral system should ideally represent a usable set of numbers, such as integers or rational numbers (Robert, 2022).</p></li>

            <li><p>Additionally, non-standard number systems such as those with negative or fractional bases have also been explored for theoretical and practical applications.</p></li>
            <li><p>Negative base systems, for instance, have potential uses in cryptography and mathematical Analysis.</p></li>
            <li><p>Rossi and Thuswaldner (2022) introduced a number system with a base of -3, demonstrating the diversity of approaches in representing numbers.</p></li>

        <h2 class="content-title">Types of Number Systems</h2>
        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Binary Number System (Base 2)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The binary number system has a base of 2 and uses only two digits: 0 and 1.</p></li>
            <li><p>It is fundamental to computer systems because digital devices operate using binary logic, where 0 represents an "off" state and 1 represents an "on" state (Olajide, 2017; Mahat et al., 2020).</p></li>
            <li><p>For instance, 1000110₂​ is a valid binary number, while a sequence like 1100200₂ is not valid because it includes a digit outside the binary system (Hussein, 2020).</p></li>
            <li><p>The binary system is the most fundamental number system in digital electronics, where a binary "bit" represents the state of an electronic switch—either on (1) or off (0) (Mahat et al., 2020).</p></li>
            <li><p>Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2. </p></li>
            <li><p>For instance, the binary number 1011 equals:  (1×2³)+(0×2²)+(1×2¹)+(1×2⁰) = 11 in decimal</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3> Octal Number System (Base 8)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The octal number system has a base of 8 and uses eight digits: 0 through 7.</p></li>
            <li><p>Each digit represents a power of 8.</p></li>
            <li><p>Octal numbers are useful in computing because they provide a shorter representation of binary numbers, grouping binary digits into sets of three (Hussein, 2020).</p></li>
            <li><p>Conversion between binary and octal is relatively straightforward since three binary digits correspond directly to one octal digit.</p></li>
            <li><p>For example, the binary sequence 101010₂​ equals 52₈ (Hussein, 2020).</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Decimal Number System (Base 10)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The decimal number system is the most familiar to humans, used in everyday counting and arithmetic. </p></li>
            <li><p>It has a base of 10 and uses ten digits: 0 through 9.</p></li>
            <li><p>Each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10, and the value of a digit depends on its position (Hussein, 2020).</p></li>
            <li><p>While binary numbers are used in computing, decimal numbers are often used for input and output purposes, with conversions handled internally (Mahat et al., 2020).</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The hexadecimal number system has a base of 16 and uses sixteen symbols: digits 0 through 9 and letters A through F, where A represents 10 and F represents 15 (Olajide, 2017).</p></li>
            <li><p>Hexadecimal is widely used in computing as a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values, with each hexadecimal digit corresponding to four binary bits (Hussein, 2020; Lande, 2014).</p></li>
            <li><p>This system is especially useful in computing because one hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary digits.</p></li>
            <li><p>For instance, 5AC₁₆​ corresponds to 10110101100₂.</p></li>
            <li><p>Hexadecimal numbers are commonly used in programming to represent binary data more compactly, such as in color coding and memory addresses (Katiyar, 2015; Hussein, 2020). </p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-subgroup">
          <h3>Other Number Systems</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Beyond the commonly used systems, alternative numeral systems like the duodecimal (base 12) system have been proposed due to their divisibility properties. They have been explored for specific applications due to their divisibility properties (Lande, 2014). While not as prevalent in computing, they offer unique advantages in mathematical computations.</p></li>
            <li><p>In a duodecimal system, symbols for 10 and 11 are typically A and B, respectively, and this system allows for more straightforward fraction representations, such as 1/3 and 1/4 (Lande, 2014). Such systems are less commonly used but have advantages in certain mathematical and practical applications.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h3>Positional Notation and Base (Radix)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>In positional number systems, the value of each digit is determined by its position and the base of the system.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>The general formula for any positional number system is: </p>
              <p><img src="../assets/formula.png" class="formula-img" /> </p>
              <p>where n is the position of the digit, and k is the highest power based on the number's length (Hussein, 2020; Katiyar, 2015).</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li><p>Converting numbers from one base to another is essential in computing, especially when interpreting machine-level data or optimizing algorithms (Mahat et al., 2020). </p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Common conversions include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>Binary to Decimal: Sum the products of each binary digit with its corresponding power of 2.</p></li>
                <li><p>Decimal to Binary: Divide the decimal number by 2 repeatedly and record the remainders.</p></li>
                <li><p>Binary to Hexadecimal: Group binary digits into sets of four and replace each with the corresponding hexadecimal digit (Katiyar, 2015).</p></li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <h3>Signed and Unsigned Numbers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>In binary systems, numbers can be:</p></li>
            <li>
              <ul>
                <li><p>Unsigned: Represent only non-negative values (0 and positive numbers). The range is from 0 to 2n−12^n - 12n−1, where nnn is the number of bits (Katiyar, 2015).</p></li>
                <li><p>Signed: Represent both positive and negative values. The two's complement method is commonly used, where the most significant bit indicates the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative), and the value is calculated accordingly (Katiyar, 2015).</p></li>
              </ul>
            </li>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>Number systems play a foundational role in mathematics and computing, shaping how we represent and process information. Various systems have emerged, each with unique applications and significance. Among these, the binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal systems stand out for their historical and practical value.</p>
        <p>The binary number system, consisting of only 0s and 1s, is the backbone of modern computing. Its simplicity allows for efficient data storage, transmission, and processing in digital electronics. As highlighted by Shamilov et al. (2021), binary operations in computers are easier to implement due to their simplicity and resilience to interference. Although its use in information technology is well known, binary's roots trace back to ancient civilizations, like the Chinese I-Ching and early Hindu mathematics.</p>
        <p>The decimal system, or base-ten, is the most familiar to humans, deeply integrated into everyday life. As noted by Arnal-Palacián and Begué (2023), the decimal system is crucial for teaching arithmetic and developing numeracy. However, it poses challenges, especially in learning place value and managing large numbers. Despite these difficulties, the decimal system's ease of use has cemented its role in human society for centuries.</p>
        <p>The octal system (base-eight) is less common but plays an important role in computing, especially in the earlier days of programming. Plantz and Berman (1971) argue that octal could be a practical alternative to decimal due to its alignment with binary, offering advantages like reduced symbols and simpler machine interfacing. However, its adoption has remained niche, primarily used by computer programmers and engineers.</p>
        <p>The hexadecimal system (base-sixteen) is widely used in computer science for its efficiency in representing large binary numbers. Strickland and Jones (2023) explain that hexadecimal uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F, which compress long binary sequences into a more manageable form. This system is instrumental in programming, memory addressing, and color coding in web design, making it indispensable in digital technology.</p>
        <p>In summary, each number system serves a distinct purpose. The binary system's simplicity underpins all computing processes, while the decimal system remains vital in education and daily life. Octal and hexadecimal, though more specialized, are essential for efficient computation and programming. These systems, developed through historical and technological progress, reflect the diverse ways humans interact with numbers.</p>
